Changelog
v0.0.1
Added sets.h and main.c

v0.0.2
Gave the insertInt function the ability to create a new Set if it's given a NULL pointer. 
(I had tried to do that originally but my understanding of pointers was flawed.)
Cleaned up the initSetWithInt function as well.

v0.0.3
Wrote the full implementation of Set in rust/set.rs. I still need to build
the CLI in rust/main.rs.

v0.0.5
Added go/set.go, added a new doc called POSTMORTEM.txt in which I wrote about
what I learned during this project.

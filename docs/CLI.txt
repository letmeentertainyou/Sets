UPDATE 
I chose not to write any tests after all and so this document is kind of a relic of my old plan.

***

The CLI in main.c largely exists for testing purposes but I have documented it here anyways. You
can also just include set.h in your project and implement the functions however you like.

There are four command line flags this binary accepts and each of them requires two additional
arguments. All this CLI does is create a Set and print it to the screen. 

Sets used as input for the CLI are in the form of integers separated by commas like so:
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,6,6,7,8,9,10,11,
The trailing comma is required.


*** Flags ***
    -n
    Use this flag to initiate a Set with an integer, arg 1 is the int to insert.
    argv 2 is the size to allocate.

    -i
    Use this flag to insert an integer into a Set, arg 1 is target Set, 
    arg 2 is the int to insert.

    -a
    Use this flag to insert an array into a Set, arg 1 is target Set,
    arg 2 is the Set to insert.

    -r
    Use this flag to remove an integer from a Set, arg 1 is target Set,
    arg 2 is the int to remove.
